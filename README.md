# datawedge-MAUI-SampleApp
Showing how to integrate Zebra Datawedge barcode readings into an existing .NET MAUI App. DW is sending readings via broadcast Intents and needs a specific profile setup which is part of this solution.

See the Releases section of this repository to download and install the DW Profile0

Alternatively, you can define a DW Profile at runtime by means of the DW Intent APIs as explained here https://techdocs.zebra.com/datawedge/11-4/guide/api/
